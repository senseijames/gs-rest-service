Spring Framework
The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the 
Java platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are
extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform. 
Although the framework does not impose any specific programming model, it has become popular in
the Java community as an addition to, or even replacement for the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) 
model. The Spring Framework is open source.

Spring Boot

From Spring.io:
"Build Anything with Spring Boot
Spring Boot is the starting point for building all Spring-based applications. Spring Boot is 
designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible, with minimal upfront configuration 
of Spring."

Spring Boot is Spring's convention-over-configuration solution for creating stand-alone, 
production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can "just run".[22] It is preconfigured 
with the Spring's "opinionated view" of the best configuration and use of the Spring platform 
and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications
need very little Spring configuration. Features:
    Create stand-alone Spring applications
    Embed Tomcat or Jetty directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
    Provide opinionated 'starter' Project Object Models (POMs) to simplify your Maven configuration
    Automatically configure Spring whenever possible
    Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration
    Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration


Criticisms
The Spring Framework has received some criticism for what some developers perceive to be an 
over-reliance on XML by Spring's container. Since version 3.0.0, however, developers have been 
able to specify all or part of an application context through annotations or Java code. Spring 
Boot makes heavy use of this to minimize the amount of configuration that must be written.
