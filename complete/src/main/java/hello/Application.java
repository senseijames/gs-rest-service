@SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
	@Configuration tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
	@EnableAutoConfiguration tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
	Normally you would add @EnableWebMvc for a Spring MVC app, but Spring Boot adds it automatically when it sees spring-webmvc on the classpath. This flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.
	@ComponentScan tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the hello package, allowing it to find the controllers.

   Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional WAR file for deployment
   to an external application server, the simpler approach demonstrated above creates a 
   standalone application.
   You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old 
   Java main() method. Along the way, you use Springâ€™s support for embedding the 
   Tomcat servlet container as the HTTP runtime, instead of deploying to an external 
   instance.
